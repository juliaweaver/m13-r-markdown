### Exercise 1 ###

library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
library(httr)

# Store a variable "movie"

movie <- 'Shrek'
# Write a function that allows you to specify a movie, then does the following:
GetReview <- function(movie) {
  
  base.url <- 'https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?'
  query.params <- list(query = movie , api_key = '3bff710e7f62430fbc8b70b2d1d8d1c9' )
  
  response <- GET(base.url, query = query.params)
  
  body<- content(response, "text")
  
  results <- fromJSON(body)
  # Construct a search query using YOUR api key
  # The base URL is https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?
  # Your parameters should include a "query" and an "api_key"
  # Note: the HTTR library will take care of spaces in the arguments
  # See the interactive console for more detail:https://developer.nytimes.com/movie_reviews_v2.json#/Console/GET/reviews/search.json
  
  
  # Request data using your search query
  
  
  # Flatten the data stored in the `$results` key of the data returned to you
  
  # From the most recent review, store the headline, short summary, and link to full article each in their own variables

  # Return an list of the three pieces of information from above
    flattened <- flatten(results$results)
  # From the most recent review, store the headline, short summary, and link to full article each in their own variables
  
  first.review <- flattened[1,]
  headline <- first.review$headline
  summary <- first.review$summary_short
  link <- first.review$link.url
  # Return an list of the three pieces of information from above
  info <-list(headline = headline, summary = summary, link = link)
  return (info)

}


# Create a variable called `movie.info` by passing your movie to your GetReview function
movie.info <- GetReview(movie)
```
